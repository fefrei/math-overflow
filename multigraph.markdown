# Working with multiple graphs

## Overview
Math-Overflow enables you to work with as manys graphs as you want (and your computing capacity can afford) at the same time.
However, working with multiple graphs simultaneously can be a little bit confusing, and so there's always only **one** active graph - the graph you're actually changing. You can recognize this one by its blue color and the grey shade.

You'll now learn

- how to create new graphs
- how to save already drawn graphs
- how to restore an already saved graph
- how to delete an already saved graph


##How to save already drawn graphs##

You're done with refining you're graph and want to compare it to a new one?

No problem: You can save your old graph by pushing the *Save Curve*-Button. Your old graph will change its color (so you don't confuse it with your active graph) and you are ready to start a new project!


##How to delete an already drawn graphs##
Working with many graphs is fun. However, when you choose that you don't need a graph anymore, you can delete it by pressing the *See saved curves*-Button. You'll get an overview of your saved curves and can delete it by pressing the *waste bin*-Button.


##How to restore an already drawn graphs##
For changing an already drawn graph, press the 
 *See saved curves*-Button. You'll get an overview of your saved curves and can restore it by pressing the *restore*-Button. This will be your new active graph.

## Using example graphs ###
You don't have an idea which curve to draw next?
Well, we've got some source of inspiration:

Just press the button *select an example* for opening one of our **predefined curves**.
You'll be surprised to see the new crop of oppurtunities :)
