# Feature overview

## Core Features

* support for all mathematical **functions** supported by JavaScript
* custom **plot ranges** and **step sizes**
* **redraw** interesting parts of the graph with higher accuracy by simply clicking on them
* easy-to-use navigation using a **custom camera control**, based on the public TrackballControls, but with **enhanced touch support**
* support for showing an **unlimited number of graphs** at the same time
* library of **example graphs**
* tested to work in **all modern browsers** (Chrome recommended for best performance)
* standard-compliant **offline mode**: visit our website once with a modern browser, use it again without being online
* support for up to three **parameters**, customizable with sliders
* can move the camera to a recommended position to have a good view on the curve


## Mobile Devices

* touch-friendly interface: every part of the UI can be used with touch
* not limited to a special mobile platform, works on iOS, Android and WindowsPhone7
* special enhancements for multi-touch navigation
* special love for Safari on iOS
	- workaround for a bug in Safari to enhance performance on iPad in landscape
	- **standalone mode**: MathOverflow on your homescreen, with custom icons and splash screens, working online or offline

## Attention to Detail

* (mostly) self-explanatory icons, some of them custom-made for our UI (and in Retina resolution)
* sliders disable if the parameter isn't used
* graphs get colored automatically when saved, so they can be distinguished
* clicking on the camera icon, the camera moves smoothly to the recommended position instead of jumping there
* controls can be hidden to have a clear view on the curve itself
* help pages are displayed inline, so you don't have to switch between this app and the pages
