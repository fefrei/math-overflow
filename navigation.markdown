# How to navigate

## Mouse & Keyboard

The **point of view** can be changed by dragging. (If you want the camera to move clockwise around the graph, click and hold the mouse button and move the mouse to the left, and vice versa.)
 
You can **zoom** in and out by scrolling.

To **pan**, hold the right mouse button while dragging.

If there is only a white screen you are too far away from the curve or looking in the wrong direction. To get to the curve, you can either try to position the camera manually or press the `camera`-button to have the camera placed automatically.

You can change to the **fullscreen mode** by pressing the *arrow button ^*  at the left.	

## Touch

To move the camera using touch events, use one finger for rotating and two fingers for panning and zooming.
