# Installing MathOverflow as a Web App on iOS

## What's that?
Math-Overflow can be saved locally, so you can use it like a real application. You can add it to your homescreen, and open it without being online.

## How-To
- Open Math-Overflow in Safari.
- Wait for the page to load.
- Tap the "share" button (rectangle with arrow pointing outwards).
- Tap "add to home screen".
- Tap "add".
- You will be redirected to your home screen, where a new icon "MathOverflow" will appear. Tap on it.
- Wait for the page to load and the "download-indicator" (arrow pointing downwards) in the middle of the screen to disappear.

That's it! Now, you can use Math-Overflow without being online.
If there's a new version available, it will be updated automatically the next time you open the application.
